# [ADR-003]: Audio Processing Strategy

## Status
Proposed (2025-05-24)

## Context
We need to implement reliable audio capture and processing for meeting transcription. The solution must handle:
1. Capturing audio from browser tabs
2. Handling permissions
3. Processing audio in chunks
4. Managing network conditions
5. Ensuring user privacy

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid approach using:
1. **Web Audio API** for capturing and processing audio
2. **Workers** for off-thread processing
3. **Chunked uploads** for better reliability
4. **Local processing** for sensitive content

### Implementation Details
- Use `chrome.tabCapture` API for tab audio capture
- Implement audio processing in Web Workers to prevent UI blocking
- Use Opus codec for efficient audio compression
- Implement chunked uploads with retry logic
- Store processing state in IndexedDB for reliability

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better performance with off-thread processing
- More reliable uploads with chunking
- Better user experience with background processing
- More efficient bandwidth usage

### Negative
- Increased complexity in state management
- Larger codebase size
- Need for careful error handling

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Server-side processing only**
   - Pros: Simpler client code
   - Cons: Higher bandwidth usage, less reliable with poor connections

2. **WebRTC for streaming**
   - Pros: Real-time processing
   - Cons: More complex setup, higher server costs
