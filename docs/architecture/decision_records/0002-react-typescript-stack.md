# [ADR-002]: Use React with TypeScript

## Status
Accepted (2025-05-24)

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework and language that will provide:
1. Excellent developer experience
2. Type safety
3. Component reusability
4. Strong ecosystem and community support

## Decision
We will use React with TypeScript for the LilaDot extension's UI because:
1. React's component model is well-suited for extension UIs
2. TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
3. Excellent tooling and IDE support
4. Strong community and ecosystem
5. Easy integration with Chrome Extension APIs

## Consequences
### Positive
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Better developer experience with autocompletion
- Easier refactoring
- Better code documentation through types
- Large ecosystem of React components and libraries

### Negative
- Additional build step required
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with TypeScript
- Slightly larger bundle size (mitigated by code splitting)

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Vanilla JavaScript**
   - Pros: No build step, smaller initial bundle
   - Cons: No type safety, harder to maintain as codebase grows

2. **Vue.js**
   - Pros: Simpler learning curve, good documentation
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem than React, less type safety

3. **Svelte**
   - Pros: Compiles to vanilla JS, no virtual DOM
   - Cons: Smaller community, less mature tooling
